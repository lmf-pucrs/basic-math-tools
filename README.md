### Approximation
- Regression and interpolation are among the most often used numerical techniques in
finance.
### Convex optimization
- A number of financial disciplines need tools for convex optimization (e.g., option
pricing when it comes to model calibration).
### Integration
- In particular, the valuation of financial (derivative) assets often boils down to the
evaluation of integrals.
